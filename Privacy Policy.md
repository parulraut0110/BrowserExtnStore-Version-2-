**Effective Date:** 13-10-2024

This privacy policy outlines how the **History Sorter by Domain and Date Extension** collects, uses, and protects any information you provide while using the extension. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.

## 1. Information We Collect
Our extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information. The extension operates entirely within your browser and does not transmit any data to remote servers or third parties.

### No User Data Collection
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), browsing history beyond the grouping and sorting process, or usage statistics from users. All processing and data handling occur locally on your device.

## 2. Permissions
Our extension requires the following permissions to function properly:
- **History**: This permission is used solely to read and organize your browserâ€™s history by domain and date. It is not shared or transmitted.
- **Storage**: This permission allows the extension to store the processed history information (grouped by domain) locally within your browser for quick access.

We do not use any other permissions, nor do we access or share any user data.

## 3. Use of Browsing History
The history data that is accessed is only used to group and sort websites based on their domain names and visit timestamps. This data remains local to your device and is not sent to any external servers.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Our extension does not use any third-party services or remote code. All functionalities are handled locally within your browser.
